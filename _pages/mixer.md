*Getting the Balance Right: Applying the Online Learning Model to Teaching Practice*

Teaching, like composing music, is as much art as science. There are many elements to balance and discord occurs if any one of the elements is in the wrong relationship to another. Technology has introduced a range of new possibilities to the teaching space but in doing so it introduces further opportunities for potential dissonance. There is no magic formula for creating fabulous music, or fabulous learning experiences, but there are principles that we know will work and combinations of elements that form pleasing patterns which we can repeat.

When composing, performing and recording a piece of music successful patterns and sound combinations used in the past are rethought and built on through a process of careful selection in the context of current practice and new ways of hearing and thinking about music. As educators we need to go through a similar process. Just as a musician builds on a personal history of scholarly expertise and immersion in music experience, developing a sense of the repertoires that please their ear and the ears of others, educators take the patterns of successful experiences and research of the past and recombine them in the new contexts of today to find the right balance for harmonious, or thrilling learning experiences.

The **Online Learning Model** proposed by CSU highlights seven elements composing a potential learning experience. These elements have been identified through prior experience and research to contribute to the composition of high quality learning experiences. They are not a mathematical formula that can be applied to every situation uniformly, the balance between the elements and the unique context of various courses determines the appropriate expression of each element. Educators must make the judgement calls at many stages along the way of planning, composing and performing learning experiences. They must weigh the needs of the experience and judge which elements to engage with in greater depth and which ones will provide better support with a lighter touch.

The sound mixer separates out elements of a piece, allowing particular features to be focused on individually. A visual display illustrates the relationships between these elements enabling choices to be made and levels adjusted. Similar decisions may be made when planning a learning cycle. It is not desirable (or possible) to focus on each element of the OLM at full volume, a balance must be achieved. Finding the right levels requires a sense of the audience, the purpose, the context and the nature of the instruments available (including the performer). 

The OLM  Mixer is a tool for illustrating the levels of potential engagement with a range of teaching strategies. It provides a range of descriptors to diagnose existing practice and a visual map of the relationships between the features in a learning cycle for future planning.

        <p>Students engage with the professions through workplace learning experiences or mentoring arrangements. Learning experiences and assignments are aligned to the workplace and/or professional contexts to ensure purposeful implementation of knowledge, skills and practice. A supportive connection between CSU, the student and partner is established before the placement (or other WPL experience) and maintained during and after its conclusion. Students are integrated into the complex and holistic aspects of the profession, developing inter-professional skills, personal ownership of their professional identity and critically reflecting on their own practice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col" title="Flexible &amp; Adaptive Learning">
        <h4>Responsive by design</h4>
        <p>Teaching approaches and activities are designed to be responsive to student behaviour and demonstrated knowledge. This flexible approach acknowledges that some cohorts of students can be quite diverse and that a one size fits all approach will not work. Utilising early data and adaptive learning systems or resources, the teacher can adjust content and experiences dynamically in order to meet the needs of a range of students.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col" title="Interactive Resources">
        <h4>Interactive &amp; adaptive resources</h4>
        <p>Adaptive learning resources allow students to interactively engage with conceptual content using personalised pathways that suit their learning needs. As students engage with simulated or rich media material, they undertake formative assessment activities which lead to adaptive presentation of content chosen to help consolidate learning or address emergent misconceptions. These learning activities can also be enhanced by the inclusion of options for shared reflection and discussion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col" title="e-Assessment">
        <h4>Contributing to real world resources</h4>
        <p>Participatory assessment tasks require students to contribute to the production of an artefact or body of work that can be used by others.

        <div class="col" title="Learning Communities">
        <h4>Networked communities</h4>
        <p>Groups are reconceptualised as a network or collective of learning. Self-organised groups are created based on automated triggers or in response to the students own needs. These groups are porous and allow the community to extend beyond the class, often engaging with the profession and external peers. Tasks are often co-operative in nature requiring students to work together to produce their own unique output, or collaborative where students work together to co-create unique output.</p>        
        </div>
        <div class="col" title="Interaction between Students">
        <h4>Communities of practice</h4>
        <p>Communities of practice are developed by students and teachers working together to engage in ways relevant to content, current issues and future professional practice. This can be achieved through the co-creation of authentic learning products where students contribute to the development of learning resources and study aids that develop their research skills and experience. Cooperative and collaborative inquiry-based or problem-based learning activities and assessment tasks are strategically designed to facilitate student interaction, leadership and shared resources with the aim of fostering skills, habits and attitudes for lifelong learning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col" title="Teacher Presence">
        <h4>Model online practice</h4>
        <p>The actions, communications and persona of the teacher encourage students to develop their own online persona and social presence in interactions with their fellow learners. Ensuring responsiveness to enquiries, assistance to difficulties and sharing pertinent information, modelling the kinds of practices that students should reflect in their own online practices.  The tone and structure of the learning environment  foster student led learning</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col" title="interaction with the Professions">
        <h4>Novice professionals</h4>
        <p>Students become part of communities of practice as novice professionals. They become agents of change and develop collaborative partnerships. Student learning is embedded in professional situations with real time support by CSU, promoting a self-directed and negotiated learning experience. Academic and professional staff also become part of a wider professional community of practice through shared projects and collaborative activities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col" title="Flexible &amp; Adaptive Learning">
        <h4>Personalised by design</h4>
        <p>This approach to personalised learning begins with the availability of dynamic learning pathways from the outset. Content, assessments, pace and even the timing of the subject is able to be adapted to suit the student. It allows the students to proceed at their own pace through differentiated or individualised pathways based on their demonstration of knowledge and competency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col" title="Interactive Resources">
        <h4>Immersive learning resources</h4>
        <p>Immersive learning resources can allow students to explore and interact within a simulated, virtual or game-based context. Such resources can be modelled on realistic authentic contexts and allow students to undertake simulated professional practices. These resources expose students to open-ended learning experiences where they can develop their professional capabilities in a safe environment. Students also benefit from explicit reflection on their practice and professional decision making and from engagement with their peers during and after undertaking simulated tasks, which can lead to follow up exploration of issues and problems beyond those generated by the resources themselves.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col" title="e-Assessment">
        <h4>Adaptive assessment</h4>
        <p>Assessments offer a range of personalised and adaptive options to provide flexibility in content focus and timing. Students receive real-time feedback in the context of authentic real world activities and are able to choose pathways aligned with their demonstrated competencies and stages of learning. Adaptive assessment tasks can include simulated tasks in immersive environments, such as virtual laboratories or virtual sites, aimed at developing professional capabilities. </p>
